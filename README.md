Software Engineering for SaaS (Software as a Service) is a free, five week online course taught by Armando Fox and David Patterson of the University of California, Berkley.

This course, along with others, was provided through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/landing/hub.php).

This repository contains my solutions (or attempts) at the assignments for the Spring 2012 session.
